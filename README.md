## Description

For this project I was tasked to generate a program using Inquirer on terminal to take user inputs and place them into a generated README.md file. From adding a functional table of contents, to images, links, and even a license and badge that is chosen by the user, we are able to generate a totally new READMEGenerated.md file!

Enjoy!
